# nvidia-highlight-stitcher

1. Install Python 3
2. Install dependencies `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit config.py and set your highlight folder. If on Windows, be sure to properly escape any spaces in your path and use forward slashes instead of backslashes. / = forward slash, \ = back slash
4. Run `python main.py`

Combined highlights will be in the combined folder. A backup of all highlights after being combined will be in the processed folder.
